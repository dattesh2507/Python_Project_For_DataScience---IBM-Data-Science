# **Python_Project_For_DataScience---IBM-Data-Science**

**The Python Project for Data Science course offered by IBM is designed to provide hands-on experience with data analysis and visualization using Python. This project-based course is an integral part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program, aimed at developing practical skills in data science.**


# üìã Project Description
For this project, I'll pretend to be a data scientist or analyst who assists clients in making stock investments at a brand-new, startup investment company. My work involves using Python libraries and web scraping popular stocks to gather financial data from multiple sources, such as quarterly sales reports and historical share prices. You will use a dashboard to display the data once it has been gathered in order to spot any trends or patterns. We'll be working with the following stocks: GameStop, AMD, Amazon, and Tesla.



# üìâ Analytics Dashboard Shown

Key performance indicators are frequently visible through a dashboard. It will be practiced to analyze a data set and extract important performance indicators. To help in learning how to access and present data in dashboards, prompts will be provided. This assignment will teach you how to set up a dashboard with important performance metrics. Plotly is not necessary to take this course, however it will be used for data visualization in it.


You used Skills Network Labs for hands-on labs in the Python for Data Science, AI, and Development course.

Watson Studio and Skills Network Labs will be used in this project. Skills Network Labs is an open-ended learning environment where students can complete course labs. When it comes to developing and implementing my initiatives, however, Watson Studio, a part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, offers a range of tools as well as a collaborative platform for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts.


# üìà Shares of stock

A stock share of a firm is a portion of the business; specifically:

A stock, sometimes referred to as equity, is a financial instrument that shows ownership of a portion of a company. This means that the stock owner is entitled to a share of the company's assets and profits based on the number of shares they own. Securities are referred to as "shares."

Purchasing stock allows one to sell it at a later time. Investors earn when the stock price rises; they lose money when the price falls.  A company's future profitability, the quantity of existing shares, and a host of other factors all play a role in determining the stock price, which is a complicated process. All day long, stock trading is conducted. A stock ticker is a report that shows the price of a certain stock and is updated by different stock market exchanges continually during the trading session. In this lab, the stock ticker and stock information will be obtained via the y-finance API. Following that, you'll be questioned with your findings.  


## üìÑ Overview The goal of this course is to show off the fundamental Python data handling abilities. Creating a dashboard with Python is a practical project that must be completed to pass this course.
